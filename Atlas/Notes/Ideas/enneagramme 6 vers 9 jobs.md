Alright ‚Äî we are talking here about a Type 6 (the Loyalist) integrating towards Type 9 (the Peacemaker).  
This means we start from the psychological base of the 6 ‚Äî vigilance, loyalty, search for security, team spirit, anticipation skills ‚Äî and add the acquired qualities of the 9 ‚Äî calm, acceptance, broad vision, pacification.

üìú **Characteristics of a Type 6 integrating towards Type 9**  
In its ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù version, the 6:

- **Becomes more serene**: less inner tension, increased self-confidence, fewer impulsive reactions to perceived threats.
    
- **Takes a step back**: adopts a broader vision, less focused on immediate dangers.
    
- **Practices acceptance**: acknowledges that some uncertainties are inevitable and that life cannot be fully controlled.
    
- **Fosters peace**: acts as a natural mediator, able to defuse conflicts instead of anxiously anticipating them.
    
- **Remains loyal and committed, but with less anxious attachment**: offers their presence in a more relaxed way.
    
- **Develops deep listening**: picks up on unspoken elements and subtle cues while staying grounded.
    
- **Keeps their anticipation skills but uses them** to build collective and calming solutions.
    
- **Focuses on relational harmony rather than simple risk prevention**.
    
- **Strengthens psychological safety around them**: becomes a figure of stability for others.
    
- **Uses humor and gentleness as tools** to de-dramatize situations.
    

**In short:** the 6 integrating into the 9 remains reliable and vigilant, but relaxes, gains perspective, and becomes a peace-builder.
